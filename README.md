RaspberryPi
===========
<br />
Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi 2 & Raspberry Pi 3 Bare Metal Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the FASMARM assembler by revolution:<br />
http://arm.flatassembler.net<br />
I have included binaries of all the demos.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to Dex (Craig Bamford), who helped me get my 1st pixel on the screen =D<br />
Please check out DexOS, a lightning fast bare metal OS, & his Raspberry Pi port of DexBasic:<br />

<br />
Also special thanks to phire, who helped me get my 1st triangle on the screen using the GPU =D<br />
<br />
Also special thanks to Jaymin Kessler, who helped me get my 1st textured triangle on the screen using the GPU =D<br />
Please check out his blog, especially for info on bare metal GPU programming on the Raspberry Pi:<br />

<br />
Also special thanks to rst, who helped me get my 1st SMP demo running using all 4 CPU cores of the Raspberry Pi 2 =D<br />
Please check out Circle by rst, a C++ bare metal environment (with USB) for Raspberry Pi 1 & 2:<br />

Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (kernel.img for Raspberry Pi, kernel7.img for Raspberry Pi 2<br />
or kernel8.img for Raspberry Pi 3) file.<br />
Using FASMARM open up kernel.asm for Raspberry Pi, kernel7.asm for Raspberry Pi 2 or kernel8.asm for Raspberry Pi 3 & click the Run/Compile button.<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with the latest bleeding edge firmware:<br />
https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot<br />
<br />
You will need these 2 files:<br />
bootcode.bin<br />
start.elf<br />
<br />
You will need to create a "config.txt" file that contains the lines:<br />
kernel_old=1<br />
disable_commandline_tags=1<br />
disable_overscan=1<br />
framebuffer_swap=0<br />
<br />
Check http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt.md for more info about config options.<br />
Check https://github.com/PeterLemon/RaspberryPi/tree/master/boot for the config.txt file.<br />
<br />
Once you have all these files ready, you can copy them & a kernel.img (Raspberry Pi), a kernel7.img (Raspberry Pi 2)<br />
or a kernel8.img (Raspberry Pi 3) file to the root of an SD card.<br />
<br />
All of my demos use a maximum resolution of 640x480, they have been tested using composite & HDMI.<br />
<br />
All sound demos output to the 3.5" Phone Jack. Thanks to ne7 for the sound sample.<br />
